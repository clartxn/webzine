              when i was in Nikko, Japan, i was at an incredible hostel in the middle of the forest that was originally an old onsen hostel, right by a river. this was my first time at a hostel by myself and there was a young group of really nice brits, australians, and canadians / americans there that we hung out with and did some excursions with. everything was super chill until this random middle aged chinese guy arrived without telling the host. he introduced himself to us and told us from the onset that he used to trade exotic bugs and had been in prison for a few years and was trying to avoid feds again by going abroad. he also said he was a dancer of some sort, but i didn’t catch what exactly he did at that time because of a language barrier. later that night we were all playing a drinking game, where if you didn’t follow a rule when a card was played you had to take a shot. this guy couldn’t totally figure the rules out but seemed down to take the shots even if we said it was chill. we were all pretty tipsy when the game ended and he decided it was time to dance. this man took off his layer to reveal his TRANSPARENT THONG LEOTARD and dances for us for what felt like hours. it was sort of fantastic. after we all went for a dip in the river (quite skinnily) he disappeared and a few hours later i found him passed out wrapped in sheets on the lower part of my bunk bed (which was not his bed). suffice to say i didn’t sleep much that night
