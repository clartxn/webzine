            Well me, Oscar and Sharif were stealing books at the Kinokumiya bookstore in an Abu Dhabi mall. I, of course, made it out the store no problem, but when Sharif and Oscar, with their backpacks full of books tried, the security guard on watch stopped them. Fortunately, because it was Christmas, and we were clearly dumb foreigners, the security team let us off the hook on the premise that we purchase the goods we would have stolen. So we did. Humiliating, but nothing more.            </p> <!-- Story -->
