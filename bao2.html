                my friend and i left ljubljana in the middle of a flood. we woke up at 5am to catch our flixbus, but it never came. god knows what happened to that flixbus. so we bought a train ticket instead to go to zagreb to catch our flight to split. the train, however, stopped in the middle of this slovenian forest called sevnica and seemed to never move. we spent 5 hours there worried sick about missing our flight, while befriending a slovenian local, who's obsessed with ron de santis. he also was figuring out a way to get a green card no matter illegal and asked us if we have "friends". the train finally moved and we got to the airport 2 hours late. however, the plane got delayed for 2 hours (viva la balkan) and we were the last to board. we made it to split alive.
