            I had like a 48-hour layover in Brunei when I was backpacking Southeast Asia last summer. I was sticking my phone through the bars outside the royal palace (bc regular ppl aren’t allowed to go inside), when this guy comes up to me and asks if I want him to take my pic. I’m solo traveling so I say “yes”, and then I ask if he wants one bc that’s just nice to reciprocate.

            Turns out, he is the nephew of the royal sultan (or some blood relation)! So I got a free tour of the royal palace, and we also hung out, he paid for all my meals, gave me some money/gifts, & even called his chauffeur to drive me back to my hostel! We were gonna hang out the next day too, until he pROPOSED TO ME!

            That’s the day I realized that I was NOT cut out to be a trophy wife. I would have to leave all my family and friends at Yale, and just stay in Brunei (which ngl was small and boring & he wasn’t that cute & he was kinda old). But this man kept texting me - he found me on insta, snap, linkedin, and even WHATSAPP so I had to block him. In another life, I could’ve been the princess of Brunei…
