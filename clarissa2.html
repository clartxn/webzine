              So I lived in Portugal for a month after studying abroad in Paris. I was staying at this surf hostel by the beach, and met this girl Naomi from London. We did a port wine tasting - it was 5 euros for 15 GLASSES between the 2 of us. Obviously, we got super drunk.

              We decided to go skinny-dipping that night in the Douro River, which cuts the city of Porto in half and flows out to the Atlantic. It was a 9-m drop-off. When we got in, we didnâ€™t realize that rivers had CURRENTS (bc it was dark & we were drunk). So we ended up getting swept out to sea!!
              
              For 30 min, we clung onto this piece of driftwood full of nails and barnacles, so we had bleeding cuts all over us. Just as we were about to let go (and die), this searchlight from a nearby cliff above finds us. This old man pulls our naked bodies out of the water! We were so happy to be alive that we got matching tattoos the next day
