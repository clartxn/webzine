             I was visiting my friend in Istanbul and was trying to leave, but then I got on the wrong airport bus and ended up in the middle of the desert. The bus driver didnâ€™t speak English, so he dropped me on the side of the road, where I hitchhiked to the nearby village in Cappadocia. 

              There, I met this guy named Erkaan, who hosted me in his hostel and took me on a hot air balloon tour! I was 18, it was my first real solo trip. It turned out to be super awesome.
