              I was taking this 10-hour night bus from Zurich back to Paris, but Flixbus had overbooked, so I didn’t have a seat. For the first 2 hours, i was literally STANDING in the back of the bus with all my stuff, it was so miserable. 

              Luckily, we got stopped for a BORDER RAID by the police when we crossed into France, and this dude on board turned out to have drugs so the police took him away. That opened up a seat for me! But I sat next to this Russian lady who kept touching my arm/legs in her sleep, and it was so god awful. We arrived at 6am in this tunnel near Saint-Denis on the outskirts of Paris, and I was just sitting there with the homeless people on a bench until my hostel check-in opened at 3am…
