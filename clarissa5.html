                 My friend and I were backpacking in Colombia, but when we pulled up to Medellin at midnight, the hostel we booked just didnâ€™t exist. Turns out, it had burned down literally that day. And we didnâ€™t have any cash. So we had to google translate English into Spanish, asking strangers if they would exchange cash with our USD and help us find a place to stay for the night ðŸ˜­ we ended up finding this crusty hostel room for like $60/n, which held us over until we booked a new hostel the next day.
