                in our final days of visiting italy with my sister, we were planning to see friends she met through her erasmus  semester in politecnico di milano. we tried to find hostels near como but couldnâ€™t find any on short notice so they decided to try to sneak us into the dorms. we waited for someone to open the back door and quietly rushed through the corridors to their room. we stayed there for two nights and nobody caught us!! we just acted like we were students
