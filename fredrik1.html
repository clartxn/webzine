                So, me and my friend was travelling to Costa Rica for spring break. While travelling to the airport my friend realised he had forgotten his passport so he had to rebook his flight and join me on the next day, making me stuck alone in a Spanish speaking country with nada knowledge of the language nor country. 
                
                On our final day we were at this cheap motel (cuz student budget) and while picking up his towel my friend felt something on his hand. Turns out it was a scorpion üòÄ We went to the reception and my friend explained it in Spanish to the woman working there. She asked how big the scorpion was, and my friend showed with his hands, to which she replied, ‚Äúdon‚Äôt worry it‚Äôs not deadly‚Äù. We were leaving at 4am the next morning so we decided to stay in the room with the scorpion. 
                
                When we woke up to leave we shook our shoes to make sure no scorpion would keep us company. However, clearly my friend didn‚Äôt do a good enough job, because when he put his shoe on there was a scorpion in it. He screamed the most gay scream I have ever heard and probably woke the whole motel up.
