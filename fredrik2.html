           During our senior year of high school, my friend Lara and I decided to go to London for a few days. When in Notting Hill, we entered a cute thrift shop. While standing next to a rack of clothes, this woman, at about 80 years old, came up to me and stood next to me. She looked over at my friend Lara, while pointing at me and said in a British accent, “well, isn’t he lovely? He looks veryyy nice”. 

          She then started scanning me up and down, stared at my crotch for a little too long, before continuing to make inappropriate comments. It came to the point where the owner of the thrift shop (who had apparently overheard everything) told the woman, “enough now”. Very nice of the man, and I almost wonder if it was a habit of this old woman to hit on gay men in this thrift shop?
