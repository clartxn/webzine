       Me and two of my friends were in Thailand the summer after senior year of high school. One of our favourite activities was going to night markets. This one night, at a market in Chiang Mei, there were a group of people dancing and singing while running around. 

My friend pointed out that they were members of this religion group (cult) called Hare Krishna. After a quick google search and seeing that they were vegetarians like me, I thought it’d be a fun plot to talk to them and hear more about their beliefs. I had a brief conversation with them before a girl in the group asked if she could add me on Facebook. Partly because I’m horrible at saying no and partly because I wasn’t thinking right I gave her my Facebook, before I quickly left. 

However, the following days the woman kept texting me about events they had in the following days and how she wanted me to join the group. I never replied, but part of me wonders what life would be like if I joined the Hare Krishna in Thailand.
