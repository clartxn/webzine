It was my first time in America, in my early teen years. Growing up in Indonesia, I was involved in the music business and had been imitating Michael Jackson since I was 10. So, the top item on my bucket list in LA was to find all things related to MJ, including his star in the Walk of Fame.

Lo and behold, my family and I encountered a group of dancers with amazing engagement with circle of audience on the sunny path in Hollywood Boulevard. They asked for a volunteer, and suddenly my family pushed me over. They started playing new music, and I had to copy their dance moves. (And push-ups, at one point.)

At another point, the dancer I was mimicking broke into the iconic King of Pop hip moves. That’s when one other dancer stopped the show and said, “Hey! No, no, no. You can’t do that. This is a family show.” And the first dancer responded, “Hm? I’m just teaching him how to make a family.” And the whole crowd vibed and erupted in laughter.

I myself had gotten in trouble in conservative Indonesia for dancing to Billie Jean’s hip moves on various stages—and I still get in trouble for it in seminary. But at least I know how to make a family.
