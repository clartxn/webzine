            <p>
  2 summers ago during my study abroad I visited Milan from Switzerland and on the train there there was this crazy thunderstorm and this station roof collapsed in the middle of the tracks so we got stuck on the train until 4 am and slept on the train

When we finally got to the Milan central train station it was flooded and there was crazy lightening and 30 mph winds outside so we got stuck there until 8 am

Then the storm finally stops but the streets are flooded so no uber will come get us so we trudge through the flooded streets to our airbnb. But we were only planning to spend one night/one day in Milan so our airbnb checkout was 10 am that day. So we got there, showered, and left for Florence lmaooo
