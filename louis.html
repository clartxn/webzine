          I've always had the dreams of visiting Türkiye after taking a university class about Byzantine architecture and archaeology. In 2023, while solo traveling I was walking and roaming the streets of Italy late in the evening in Roma, Italy. I was walking towards the metro station and I remember walking beside a woman simultaneously. Her and I both noticed that the metro station was closed and the gates had closed. We both chatted for a bit and quickly clicked and connected. We then shared our stories of solo traveling and I told her my love for traveling to Türkiye. Coincidentally, she was Turkish and grew up in Turkey most of her life, but lived in Houston, Texas with her family. 


 She told me that she has lots of friends and family still living in Türkiye and asked whether I had a place to stay/connections in Türkiye. Naturally, I said I didn't really have a plan but intended on visiting. "Nothing set in stone, I replied." She extended out an invitation right there and told me I could visit her friends and even potentially stay with her family if logistically, it was possible. We traded contacts and kept in touch for a few weeks. She sent me all things to do, places to visit, places to stay, things to stay away from, all sorts of information that one would need to know about Türkiye.  


Once I had planned and scheduled my flights for Istanbul, i informed her and she told me that her friends would be able to host me in Beşiktaş. Furthermore, that if I was to make my way to Bursa, her family would be able to host me as well and I could stay for free. We sorted out the logistics and I ended up staying with her friends for a week for free, stayed with her parents for a few nights in Bursa and got to visit all the local spots of the city. Her friends and family all cooked for me and showed me the best hospitality/love that money cannot buy. ￼ ￼ ￼


I ended up traveling to over 6 cities all across Türkiye because of this one woman. Forever indebted to her and her hospitality. So grateful for the opportunity and to be able to share and the love for her country was the coolest experience.
