                During the Summer of 2024 when I was in Japan, my family and I were staying in this cute coffee shop, and we had to leave early in the morning for a train. We decided that we would walk, but then out of nowhere, it started down pouring, and the streets got flooded. My passport and everything got soaked, and we were 1 minute from missing the train.
