                I was left with my croatian family whom I could not speak to (language barrier) but my brother would translate. My uncle was picking us up for dinner and told him something in Croatian that my brother did not want to translate. Thinking nothing of it we go in the car. That was the fastest I have ever gone in a car, around curves passing cars crossing the other side of the road. In a shitty dinker ass car. Later my brother told me that my uncle said “I’m drunk let’s go!” Not telling us so we would freak out
