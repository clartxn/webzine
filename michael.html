                I was on a climbing trip to Switzerland where we spent a week bouldering in magic wood. Super fun & beautiful honestly. Lots of cows. Anyways lowkey got my backpack stolen on the train back from Switzerland to Budapest. At approximately 3 am someone crept into our 6-person compartment while we were all sleeping, took only my bag, and got off in Austria. We were a little hungover and the one friend who was up was on a smoke break at the stop. So I lost the bag I had since I was in middle school unfortunately
