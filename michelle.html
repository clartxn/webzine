  I was flying into Paris BVA airport, which is 1.5 hours away from Paris St. Denis by shuttle. After we got to St. Denis, we proceeded to travel to NYU in Paris to crash at our friend’s. Keep in mind, it is already 1AM. When we finally get to NYU in Paris an hour later by metro, we get a text from our friend. We had never confirmed the address. We were traveling in the opposite direction.
            <br>

We try to call an Uber. We tried to book a shared Uber, not realizing that was only for one person. He saw the two of us and drove away. We tried to book another Uber for 20 minutes to no avail. We try to hail a taxi, but they are all full. When we finally get one, he seems confused about the address but starts taking us to our friends apartment.
            <br>

On the way to the apartment, we are almost there when he seems rather lost. He’s going in circles and taking random turns. We tell him we can get off. He continues driving. He turns into this narrow alley that is clearly meant for walking and tries driving through it. He cannot make it through. Once he realizes this, it is another 30 minutes of slowly reversing the car inch by inch until he can get out. Our friend walks to come meet us. By the time we get back to his apartment it is 3:30AM.
