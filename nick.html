                Me and my parents were in random countryside in Bosnia and got an Airbnb for the night. We arrived there late, like 11pm, and it was pitch black out. The gps told us to turn onto this like hilly dirt road with no lights and a small faded sign that pointed towards the name of the Airbnb. When we arrived at the house, no lights were on so we got out and opened the metal gate and walked towards the house with only our small phone flashlights giving us light. There was a swimming pool with no water in it and a cat moved in the yard and made a rustling noise which scared us. We went up to the door and rang the doorbell of the house but no answer. It felt like a scene of a horror movie, stuck in the middle of nowhere in the dark Bosnian countryside with no place to stay for the night and off the main road at this creepy house. There was no place to turn our car around on the road so we had to make a tight turn by the concrete wall near the house and had to put rocks on the tires of the car so it wouldnâ€™t roll back and hit the wall since it was on a hill. We wound up making it out alive and found another place to stay like an hour down the road but it was creepy
