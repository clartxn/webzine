                  My friend Clarissa and I were taking a train from Amsterdam to Brussels. We found out that we were riding a luxury train, costing about 250 euros rather than our intended budget train of 15 euros. When the ticket checker came to us, I told Clarissa not to speak a lick of French and act like the stupid Americans we were. I exaggerated my American accent, while also making sure to speak very loud as to make sure they knew we had zero understanding of the European train system. He gave us a warning and we took the train all the way to Brussels!
