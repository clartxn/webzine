                My friends and I were waiting for our Uber to pick us up from a bus station in Costa Rica, facing constant harassment from (scam) taxi drivers offering ‘cheaper’ rides. One member of our group had enough and told them off in Spanish. As we got in our Uber, the taxi drivers began EGGING our Uber’s car. 5 out of 5 stars and a large tip for our driver (sorry random Costa Rican Uber driver)
