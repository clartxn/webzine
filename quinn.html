            <p>
              I was in mexico with my family in Tulum, and i went out to dinner with my family. After dinner, we went back and the car was gone. We were really scared because our passports were in there. So i had to talk to national guard, and there were huge trucks with rifle guns. They took me to the police station. I was the only one who spoke Spanish in my family, so I said “donde esta mi carro?”, and I had to pay a fine.
