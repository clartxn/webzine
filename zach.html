                After high school graduation, my roommate/step-brother/best friend and I decided to stop kicking rocks and do something that summer. We “planned“ (quotations because nothing was actually planned) a two week road trip from Florida to Canada. We had nothing but a few hotels booked and energy drinks to our name. After grueling days of driving, we arrived at our hotel in Quebec — and man, was it beautiful. Too beautiful, almost. We spent the next day exploring the hotel, browsing the amenities, and gaining an appetite. We’d seen a restaurant at the hotel, so we decided to book a dinner there to check it out. That’s when the hostess hit us with, “which restaurant?” Dumbfounded, we were. Then it clicked — the price, the amenities, the view — this was a resort and we didn’t realize. Well, safe to say we ran through our budget in the first week and struggled the next. 10/10 experience, would recommend!
